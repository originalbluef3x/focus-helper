# Focus Helper
## Free distractions with a simple tool while limiting browsing and entering fullscreen.

Focus Helper is designed with the intention of giving students or anyone else a very simple tool to open a new isolated browser window that helps to minimize distractions. 
Our sleek, minimal interface is easy on the eyes and dead simple to use. Configurable to use any browser or search engine of your choosing.

### Future Plans:
